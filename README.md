# Cracking The Coding Interview, 6th Edition - Solutions a la Python

Because who doesn't love Python, right?

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to eventually create a central, complete guide to Python solutions of the problems contained in *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition* by Gayle Laakman McDowell.

I will do my best to write clean, beautiful, correct, and efficient code. Some solutions may not fulfill all of these goals, and I welcome your criticism and feedback.

I also hope that this project serves as a learning utility for bettering my software development etiquette. I will make a strong effort to always include the problem statement of each question, write proper docstrings, as well as include the time and space complexity (to the best of my knowledge) of my solutions.

I will also try to include a few corner unit test cases as proof of correctness for each of my solutions.

## Why Python?

I love python.

Seriously though, check it out. There's a lot to love. Python is fast, clean, readable, easy to debug, and dynamically typed. IMO, there is nothing simpler for interview questions, and so far my only complaint about the book is the author's decision to make Java the language of choice for solutions. Focusing on syntax-specific errors is a waste of your time and your interviewer's.
